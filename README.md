## DVRPC 2050 Municipal-Level Population and Employment Forecasts in Five-Year Increments
As a part of DVRPCâ€™s long-range planning activities, the Commission is required to maintain forecasts with at least a 20-year horizon, or to the horizon year of the long-range plan. Allocation of growth is forecasted using a land use model, UrbanSim, and working closely with member county planning staffs. DVRPC has prepared regional, county, and municipal-level population and employment forecasts in five-year increments through 2050, using 2015 Census population estimates and 2015 National Establishments Time Series (NETS) employment data as the base (adopted June 24, 2021).
